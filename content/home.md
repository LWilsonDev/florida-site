intro_1: A Family Disney Escape. Luxurious family villa boasting an oversized, private pool & spa overlooking a beautiful conservation area. A south-west facing outlook offers sunshine from early till late. The property is just 15 minutes from Disney’s attractions and located on the highly desirable Manor at West Haven gated community. It’s just minutes from the restaurants, bars, golf and amenities of bustling, upmarket Champions Gate.
intro_2: A spacious and well-appointed pool house located on the tree-lined gated community of Manor at West Haven, Davenport. The villa is ideally located – 15 minutes from Disney World, less than 5 minutes from Champions Gate (which includes Publix supermarket and championship golf) and 15 minutes from the up-and-coming Posner Park shopping mall.
intro_3: The villa is fitted to a high specification throughout. Key features include 6 Roku flatscreen TVs (one outside), complimentary Wi-Fi, a kitchen featuring Corian surfaces, stainless steel appliances, a coffee machine and washer/dryer facilities in a separate utility room. Both the indoor and outdoor dining areas comfortably seat eight people. All bedding, towels and pool towels are provided.
intro_4: We also try to help make the journey as hassle-free as possible for young families. A travel cot and high-chair are both available free of charge. The pool has a removable child security fence available and every rear door is fitted with a pool alarm that is activated when opened. The Manor community is a welcoming environment and offers a communal swimming pool, tennis court and a children’s playground – all within a short walk of the property.
intro_5: We hope the memories you make whilst guests at our villa stay with you for a lifetime.
